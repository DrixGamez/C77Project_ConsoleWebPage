        Visual Studio Code or aka VSC is a visual type coding software (hince its name) which basically helps coders visually test some code to see if it would work on the actual website.
        To get Visual Studio Code set up, first you have to download Visual Studio Code. Once you have downloaded it, you should open it, and then you will see a pale screen with the VSC's
        logo on it. After that, you have to make a blank file and call it whatever you like-an example would be: ExampleCoding. You can name it whatever you would like.
        Once your done making a file, go on to VSC and then on screen in the middle, it will say "Open file" or something like that-once you click on it, you will be on your finder or folder, 
        and then you should open your file. Then you can start coding, making index.html, style.css, and main.js.

The console screen, often referred to as the command line interface (CLI) or terminal, is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or specific software applications. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that rely on visual elements and mouse-based interactions, the console screen allows users to input commands and receive text-based outputs.
Why is the Console Screen Used?
Efficiency: The console screen is often favored by developers, system administrators, and power users for its efficiency in executing commands. Many tasks can be performed more quickly using keyboard commands than through graphical interfaces.
Resource Efficiency: Console interfaces typically consume fewer system resources compared to graphical interfaces, making them suitable for server environments or situations where system resources are limited.
Scripting and Automation: The console is an essential tool for scripting and automation. Users can create scripts to automate repetitive tasks, allowing for faster and more consistent execution of commands.
Remote Access: In many cases, the console provides a means for remote access to a system, allowing users to manage servers or devices without a graphical interface.
